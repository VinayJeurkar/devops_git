Steps to copy the files recursively in cross region replication from myversioningbucket28 bucket to replicationbucket28-sydney bucket.

Use the already created bucket myversioningbucket28 and upload any files to it.
Create  new bucket replicationbucket28-sydney. (change location to Sydney)
Now to Replicate the files from myversioningbucket28 bucket to replicationbucket28-sydney bucket
get into the myversioningbucket28 bucket and find the tab managment >> replication >> entire bucket >> next >> select the destination bucket as replicationbucket28-sydney bucket
>> enable versioning >> storage: standard (if you want to or leave it unticked >> next >> IAM role : SCRR >> ext >> save >> creates cross region replication

the myversioningbucket28 bucket has all the files
But the objects won't be replicated in the replicationbucket28-sydney bucket automatically.
To move the files/objects in the replicationbucket28-sydney bucket we use the CLI:

Install AWS MSI CLI for windows in 64 bit from the link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-windows.html

C:\Users\Rachna>aws configure

Go to the AWS console:
Services >> Security >> IAM >> Groups >> create a new group with admin rights >> add a user to the the group with programmable rights >>
Once you add the user you will get the below credentials. Use them to login to the CLI.

C:\Users\Rachna>aws s3 ls
2019-01-30 09:41:31 myversioningbucket28
2019-01-30 09:59:33 replicationbucket28-sydney
2019-01-29 13:56:32 test.bucket1991

C:\Users\Rachna>aws s3 cp --recursive s3://myversioningbucket28 s3://replicationbucket28-sydney
copy: s3://myversioningbucket28/rach.txt to s3://replicationbucket28-sydney/rach.txt
copy: s3://myversioningbucket28/Chrysanthemum.jpg to s3://replicationbucket28-sydney/Chrysanthemum.jpg
copy: s3://myversioningbucket28/Desert.jpg to s3://replicationbucket28-sydney/Desert.jpg

Once the objects are copied we then go back to the bucket and see that the replicationbucket28-sydney bucket has all the files.

Case 1 :
In the myversioningbucket28 bucket, edit the text file and change it and upload the edited file you will see the same file with 2 different versions and you will be 
able to see the same files in the replicationbucket28-sydney bucket.

Case 2 :
Go to the original bucket: myversioningbucket28  and delete the text file and you will see the delete marker of that file in show versions.
Now when you move to the  replicationbucket28-sydney bucket you can see the files would be present here and there would not be any delete marker for the same.
Any actions on the original bucket would not affect the replicated bucket and this is a security feature.
1. Only changes and additions will be affected.
2. deletions (delete markers, deleted files/objects) would not be done on the replicated bucket.
3.
4.
